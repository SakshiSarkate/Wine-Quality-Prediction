#Wine is an alcoholic drink that is made up of fermented grapes.
Machine learning models can tell us exactly what makes a good quality wine. 
And, surprisingly, the process is quite simple. 
All it takes is wine data collection, preparation, and finding the most accurate and effective wine quality classification approach by comparing classification scores of different ML methods.
For this project, I used Kaggle’s Red Wine Quality dataset to build various classification models to predict whether a particular red wine is “good quality” or not.
Each wine in this dataset is given a “quality” score between 0 and 10. For the purpose i refered the Project of @amberkakkar01 who converted the output to a binary output where each wine is either “good quality” (a score of 7 or higher) or not (a score below 7).

The quality of a wine is determined by 11 input variables:
    Fixed acidity
    Volatile acidity
    Citric acid
    Residual sugar
    Chlorides
    Free sulfur dioxide
    Total sulfur dioxide
    Density
    pH
    Sulfates
    Alcohol

Objectives : To experiment with different classification methods to see which yields the highest accuracy
